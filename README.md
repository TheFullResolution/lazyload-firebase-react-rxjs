# RX Chat App

## General Information

Simple chat app built using:

 - react
 - redux
 - [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/)
 - [redux-observable](https://redux-observable.js.org/)
 - [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
 - [rxfire](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rxfire)

Firebase package is lazy loaded using webpack and RxJS.

### Why?

"*Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.*"

Pretty much that quote sums up this project. Definitely, these are very heavy packages for such a small project, but they are here all together as the proof concept mixed with a framework which is not commonly used with RxJS.

Building this project using Angular and AngularFire would be definitely easier, but I learned more about RxJS, since there are not many ready recipes for this mix. 

## Usage

You can check project here: [https://rxchatapp.netlify.app](https://rxchatapp.netlify.app)
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/b40b52dd-efe5-4709-bdeb-07e78a9b577c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/rxchatapp/deploys)

Or, after installing all the dependencies locally using `npm npm i`, run `npm start`

In order to use the project, you have to log in, or create an account. I do not send any confirmation emails here, you can use a fake one.
